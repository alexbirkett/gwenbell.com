+ **10 Apr** Each Spring I'm reminded one Spring will be my last.
+ **9 Apr** Launchdaymazingness. [Git for Publishers](http://git.gwenbell.com/) is here!
+ **2 Apr** Unless you're Nunu, you won't hear from me for a few days. Going under to finish Git for Publishers. Check my [commits](http://github.com/gwenbell) if you're wanting to play in code! Or find me on [http://socialno.de](http://socialno.de/) (accessible by CJDNS) where I'll be blowing off steam for five minutes per day.
+ **1 Apr** This city. Is. 
+ **1 Apr** Moved into new apt in Bed-Stuy. Settling in with yoga and the sounds of a construction crew. 
+ **31 Mar** Moving into my new apartment. In New York City. This is a first. Eeeeee!
+ **31 Mar** Started the day finding 5 of the 48 Easter eggs. Then, won 3 Uno games in a row. Now, making commits to Git for Publishers on Gitboria. While eating banana chocolate chip pancakes, listening to Money Trees. Ya bish. 
+ **30 Mar** That was...officially...the best day of all time.
+ **29 Mar** Programming. Writing. Eating bacon cheeseburgers cooked by one master cheeseburger artist. Dancing around to Radiohead. Napping with two cats. Tubular Friday.
+ **28 Mar** Walked through Hasidic Jewish Williamsburg last night. One of the most surprising, surreal things I've done in some time. Read [Escape from the Holy Shtetl](http://nymag.com/news/features/48532/) when I got home - beautiful piece, frame.
+ **28 Mar** "One customer in a queue in Nicosia told the BBC's Tim Willcox he was withdrawing the allowed daily amount of 300 euros ($383; Â£253) but would take out all of his money if he could." [Tim Willcox for the BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-21963462)
