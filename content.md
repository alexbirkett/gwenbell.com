+ **14 Apr** New [About](http://gwenbell.com/about). Hooray. Next, to yoga to decompress. Intense weekend on the machine!

If you're migrating off WordPress because of the [brute force attacks](http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/04/huge-attack-on-wordpress-sites-could-spawn-never-before-seen-super-botnet/), boredom or frustration that your plugins are borked, holler.
