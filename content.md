1 Apr 2013 |  Moved into new apt in Bed-Stuy. Settling in with yoga and the sounds of a construction crew. 

31 Mar 2013 | Moving into my new apartment. In New York City. This is a first. Eeeeee!

31 Mar 2013 | Started the day finding 5 of the 48 Easter eggs. Then, won 3 Uno games in a row. Now, making commits to Git for Publishers on Gitboria. While eating banana chocolate chip pancakes, listening to Money Trees. Ya bish. 

30 Mar 2013 | That was...officially...the best day of all time.

28 Mar 2013 | Walked through Hasidic Jewish Williamsburg last night. One of the most surprising, surreal things I've done in some time. Read [Escape from the Holy Shtetl](http://nymag.com/news/features/48532/) when I got home - beautiful piece, frame.

Bed-Stuy Code or Die
====================

7 Apr 2013
----------

**Code**

Code or Die came like a flash from Biggie Smalls' brain to my heart as I sat at the Bed-Stuy donut shop, eating a salted caramel. 

Code. I'm singularly obsessed with deepening and deepening into code. It strikes me I have no other option, nor do I want one. 2011. Moved to Mexico for three months. Off, off grid. Lived in a hotel on the water for a month, swang in a hammock and communed with baby geckos and beautiful women whose hips sashayed.

I love Mexico, and I missed the web. You can't be offline and watch the web now, can't comment on it, can't just use it - have to code it. I became a programmer because I got fed up with the lack of programmers building the kinds of things I want. Got back from Mexico at the start of 2012. SF for three months, but uninspired. So I hit the skies, flying to Singpaore to kick it off. As I traveled the globe in 2012 I'd sit down with someone at a pub and say 'I want this. Can you code it?' Weeks later, nothing.

I want clean code, I want spanking beats. I want code only I can create. That's why I became a programmer.

**Die**

The death piece. I spent the last night of my mom's life massaging her dying body with fragrance-free lotion I can still smell. She died in my grandmother's arms a few hours later. Since then, I've only done with my life what I want to do with it. Some find this kind of seriousness about life unnerving. Since my mom's death I've been preparing for my own. You hit this point, the rubber meets the road - and you know you're in it or you're sniffling your way home. I always choose to be in it. This is where the rubber meets the road. 

_Program or be programmed._ 
_Code or die._

6 Apr 2013
----------

It's almost eleven on Saturday, 6 April 2013.

I hear a plane overhead. I felt the G-train. I woke up in a puddle of my own drool.

Yesterday I met with Marius, the ghost of Biggie and a cup of coffee I drank, the donut I didn't eat. Actually, he ate more donut than I did. It was a good conversation, but otr. As anything worth talking about these days is.

Then, I got back to the apartment, laid down for a few minuts but mind was going so fast I decided to walk it off.

Walked to Manhattan, by going through Hasidic Jewville once again, and then crossed the bridge by foot. It was a spectacular day. The light.

Then, got back. Ross and Anne were here. Ross had taken a seventeen hour flight to get here and he's here for the entire month. This'll be good. Most of it otr, as with Marius.

Because, actually, I'm finding it better to let things percolate here rather than just add it to the status update page. Speaking of percolate. Bitters.

Continued work on Bitters by talking with them about what it would be like if it were ideal for them too. Nailed the Git beat.

After chicken quesadillas, laid down my head and began creating the drool puddle in which I awoke.
