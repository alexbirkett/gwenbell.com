Quick Jam NYC

It's almost eleven on Saturday, 6 April 2013.

I hear a plane overhead. I felt the G-train. I woke up in a puddle of my own drool.

Yesterday I met with Marius, the ghost of Biggie and a cup of coffee I drank, the donut I didn't. Actually, he ate more donut than I did. It was a good conversation, but otr. As anything worth talking about these days is.

Then, I got back to the apartment, laid down for a few minutes but mind was going so fast I decided to walk it off.

Walked to Manhattan, by going through Hasidic Jewville once again, and then crossed the bridge by foot. It was a spectacular day. The light.

Then, got back. Ross and Anne were here. Ross had taken a seventeen hour flight to get here and he's here for the entire month. This'll be good. Most of it otr, as with Marius.

Because, actually, I'm finding it better to let things percolate here rather than just add it to the status update page. Speaking of percolate. Bitters.

Continued work on Bitters by talking with them about what it would be like if it were ideal for them too. Nailed the Git beat.

After chicken quesadillas, laid down my head and began creating the drool puddle in which I awoke.
