+ **12 Apr** Huge, huge week. Ended with a personal note from YC the Cynic. I nearly died b/c I got it _as I was listening_ to his track.
+ **10 Apr** Each Spring I'm reminded one Spring will be my last.
+ **9 Apr** Launchdaymazingness. [Git for Publishers](http://git.gwenbell.com/) is here!
+ **2 Apr** Unless you're Nunu, you won't hear from me for a few days. Going under to finish Git for Publishers. Check my [commits](http://github.com/gwenbell) if you're wanting to play in code! Or find me on [http://socialno.de](http://socialno.de/) (accessible by CJDNS) where I'll be blowing off steam for five minutes per day.
+ **1 Apr** This city. Is. 
+ **1 Apr** Moved into new apt in Bed-Stuy. Settling in with yoga and the sounds of a construction crew.
