About
-----

I'm a tech writer and hacker based in Brooklyn, NY. I love it here. This city hums and thumps and blank slates me each day.

I work in tech. While my tech interests are broad, as of 2013 my primary focus on work is in cryptography. To that end, I can help you [learn Git](http://git.gwenbell.com/). <mark>Using Git makes me a stronger, more productive writer and a braver, more competent hacker</mark>.

Here's a timely reason to learn Git. Git can't turn into [a botnet](http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/04/huge-attack-on-wordpress-sites-could-spawn-never-before-seen-super-botnet/). With your CMS, you're vulnerable.

With Git, if anything changes in my writing, or in my code, I know it immediately. When I go to merge changes, if something changed on my server that I didn't push, I'd know. If that happened, I'd just hit delete, clone down my repo again, and I'm in the clear.

If this is all G(r)eek to you, read [Git for Publishers](http://git.gwenbell.com/). If you need some catch up sessions to get up to speed on tech basics, I'm [gwen at gwenbell.com](mailto:gwen@gwenbell.com).
