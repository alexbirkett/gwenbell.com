About
-----

I'm a tech writer and hacker. I moved to Brooklyn in March 2013. I committed to a short-term lease here. And I love it. This city hums and thumps and blank slates me each day.

I work in tech. While my tech interests are broad, as of 2013 I'm primarily focused on cryptography. To that end, I can help you [learn Git](http://git.gwenbell.com/). <mark>Using Git has made me a stronger, more productive writer and a braver, more competent hacker</mark>.

One timely reason I use Git is Git can't turn into [a botnet](http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/04/huge-attack-on-wordpress-sites-could-spawn-never-before-seen-super-botnet/). With your CMS, if you're not watching it (and even if you are) you're vulnerable.

With Git, if anything changes in my writing, or in my code, I know it immediately. When I go to merge changes, I can see something else has changed on my server. Then, I'd know. Something is wrong. Then, I just hit delete, clone down my repo again, and I'm in the clear.

If this is G(r)eek to you, read [Git for Publishers](http://git.gwenbell.com/).
