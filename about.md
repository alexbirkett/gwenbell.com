About
-----

I'm a tech writer based in Brooklyn, NY. I love it here. This city hums and thumps and blank slates me.

I work in tech. While my tech interests are broad, as of April 2013 I focus on cryptography. To that end, I can help you [learn Git](http://git.gwenbell.com/). <mark>Using Git makes me a stronger, more productive writer and a braver, more competent web developer</mark>.

Git is a vast world. It's a tool I'm both learning and using daily, and teaching and supporting others in learning. Git can't turn into [a botnet](http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/04/huge-attack-on-wordpress-sites-could-spawn-never-before-seen-super-botnet/). With your CMS, you're vulnerable.

Instead of using CMS, I build with [Bitters](https://github.com/gwenbell/bitters.git). Bitters is a custom-created combination of the beautiful Jade language, JavaScript, Node.js, and Markdown. It's a pleasure to code in, and as a result I grow and prune it daily.

If this is all g(r)eek to you, read [Git for Publishers](http://git.gwenbell.com/). 

I'm [gwen at gwenbell.com](mailto:gwen@gwenbell.com).
