About
-----

I'm a technical writer and web developer based in Brooklyn, New York. I love it here. This city hums and thumps and blank slates me.

As of April 2013 I focus on making you and the stuff you've got on the web more secure. To that end, I help clients [learn Git](http://git.gwenbell.com/).

Instead of using a CMS, which might be [a botnet in disguise](http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/04/huge-attack-on-wordpress-sites-could-spawn-never-before-seen-super-botnet/), I build with [Bitters](https://github.com/gwenbell/gwenbell.com). 

Bitters is a custom-created combination of the beautiful Jade language, JavaScript, Node.js, and Markdown. And as with actual bitters, it's a delight to enjoy daily.

If this is g(r)eek to you, read [Git for Publishers](http://git.gwenbell.com/). I'm [gwen at gwenbell.com](mailto:gwen@gwenbell.com).
